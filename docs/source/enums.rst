ModDB Enums
============
The Enums in this library are used to give a global perspective of all the possible options of a filter for searching
or to restrict and make more comparable enum-like attributes parsed from the html. Some of the enums are extremely long
and in no particular order, that is because they were scraped directly from the moddb search pages in that order and the
values are necessary for the filtering.
