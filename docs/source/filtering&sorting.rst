Filtering and Sorting
=======================
When searching for pages you can often refine those searches using filters
and sorting. Filtering is the act of purposfully restricting the results
returned to only those matching a certain number of criterias and sorting 
is displaying those results based on the ascending or descending value of 
a field. 

The documentation for filtering and sorting models is found within the
documentation of the models themslves. E.g. To find the documentation
for filtering and sorting a Mod page, look at the moddb.Mod documentation.

Filtering accepts any number of the arguments listed under the Filtering
section of each model. Sorting accepts a single argument along with the 
value 'desc' or 'asc'. You cannot sort by multiple arguments.
